// Searching operation
// linear search, means, start from 0 index and check one by one every index number, 
// it's advantage is that, even if the array is not in sorted order, still it can search the required number easily 

// binary search , means, I'll give you range as well , to search the value, and everytime you have to start with the middle value , 
// if the range is given greater than 500, then we will skip the numbers from 1 to 500, and , the array needs to be is sorted form for binary search 
// the number of comparisons are being divided, 
//
